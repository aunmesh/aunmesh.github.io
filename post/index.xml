      <description>Note This post is written in the form of an interview. Reasons* below
When was your GRE and when did you start preparing for it? My GRE was on 5th of July. I started preparing for it around 20th of May.
What was your score? I scored 160&amp;frasl;170 in Verbal Section, 168&amp;frasl;170 in Quantitative Section and 4&amp;frasl;6 in Analytical Writing Skills.
You had 2 weeks for preparation. Do you think it was enough for you?</description>
